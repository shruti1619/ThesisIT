## About the Project

Managing final-year project records is time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to data loss — whether stored physically or in scattered digital files. **ThesisIT** solves this by providing a single, organized web platform where:

- Students can **submit and track** their projects across multiple seminar stages
- Faculty/Project Guides can **evaluate and give feedback** at each stage
- Junior students can **browse and learn** from past projects
- Admins can **manage users, groups, and academic records**

---

## Features

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| Student | Register, form groups, submit project details & files per seminar stage, track progress |
| Project Guide | View assigned groups, evaluate seminars, give marks & feedback |
| Admin | Manage all users, groups, guides; monitor submissions |
| Alumni | Past project visibility for knowledge sharing |
| Public | Browse Project Hub — a searchable archive of completed projects |

Key highlights:
- Role-based authentication with JWT (Student / Guide / Admin)
- Multi-stage project submission (up to 6 seminars for Final Year, 3 for Third Year)
- Project Refinery — a space for students to ideate and refine project ideas
- Project Hub — public archive of all completed projects with team details
- File upload support (PPTs, videos, reports, posters, source code)
- Evaluation system with per-member marks across multiple criteria
- Alumni integration for team continuity
